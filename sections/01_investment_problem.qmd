# The Investment Problem {#sec-investment-problem}

## The End of "Plain" Solar

The historical investment model for utility-scale solar PV in the Australian National Electricity Market is broken. For years, renewable energy developers relied on long-term fixed-price Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) spanning 7-15 years to secure project finance. These contracts provided the revenue certainty needed to support high-leverage debt structures typical of infrastructure investments.

That model has collapsed.

## The Collapse of the Unfirmed PPA

With the end of the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) and rapidly increasing solar penetration, the economics of daytime generation have fundamentally changed. The problem is straightforward: when everyone generates at the same time, prices collapse.

### Solar Anti-Correlation

The wholesale electricity price during solar hours (10:00-16:00) in NSW tells the story clearly:

The data reveals two devastating trends for solar investors:

1. **Price Cannibalization**: Solar hour wholesale prices have declined by over 50% from 2018 to 2025, from approximately $80-90/MWh to less than $40/MWh

2. **Physical Curtailment**: Solar generators are not just facing low prices—they're being physically curtailed due to grid congestion during solar peaks. Curtailment has increased from less than 1% in 2018 to over 5% by 2025.

### The PPA Problem

Infrastructure investors don't just want high prices—they need **contracted** revenue. The challenge is that corporate offtakers increasingly refuse to sign long-term PPAs for plain solar at any price. Why would a commercial buyer lock in a fixed rate for power that's only generated when grid prices are lowest?

The traditional financing waterfall is broken:
- **Can't contract** → Can't size debt
- **Can't size debt** → Can't hit return hurdles
- **Can't hit returns** → Can't deploy capital

## The Certificate Cliff

The revenue problem extends beyond wholesale electricity. Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs), which historically provided 30-40% of solar project revenue, have collapsed as the LRET obligation has been fulfilled.

**LGC pricing trajectory:**
- January 2024: ~$50/certificate
- January 2026: ~$6.50/certificate

The market transitions to a voluntary scheme post-2030 through Guarantees of Origin (GOs). However, GOs include a **time-stamp element**—certificates are matched to the exact hour of consumption. Just as physical solar-hour power is oversupplied, solar-hour GOs will likely trade at a significant discount to off-peak certificates, further depressing returns.

## The Curtailment Risk

Investors are not just facing revenue risk from low prices. They face **volume risk** from physical curtailment:

- **Grid congestion**: Solar farms in regional NSW are often at the end of transmission lines with limited export capacity
- **AEMO intervention**: Semi-scheduled generators can be directed to reduce output when local network constraints bind
- **Wasted generation**: Curtailed energy represents sunk capital with zero return

For existing solar assets approaching PPA expiry, the prospect of uncontracted merchant exposure to these conditions represents a material valuation risk. A solar farm that can't reliably sell its output is an infrastructure asset with a fundamental flaw.

## The Investment Imperative

The conclusion for infrastructure capital is clear: **pure solar is no longer financeable** at acceptable risk-adjusted returns in competitive regions of the NEM.

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) offer the obvious technical solution—shift generation from oversupplied daylight hours to valuable evening peaks. But this raises the critical question that motivates this entire analysis:

**Should batteries be co-located with solar, or deployed as standalone assets?**

The answer determines:
- Capital deployment sizing (small vs. large projects)
- Revenue structure (contracted vs. merchant)
- Location optimization (solar sites vs. grid access points)
- Return profiles (infrastructure vs. opportunistic)

The following sections provide a framework for making this decision systematically.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Solar hour wholesale prices in NSW have declined >50% from 2018-2025
- Curtailment has increased >5x over the same period
- LGC revenues have collapsed from $50 to $6.50/certificate
- Pure solar PPA contracting has become increasingly difficult
- Infrastructure investors face a binary choice: add BESS or accept merchant risk
