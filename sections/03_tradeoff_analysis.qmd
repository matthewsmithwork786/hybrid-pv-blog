### The Standalone Model

**Current market reality:** The majority of batteries in the NEM are deployed as standalone facilities. This is not by accident—it reflects deliberate optimization for multiple revenue streams.

### Strategic Advantages of Standalone BESS

#### 1. Siting Freedom

Standalone batteries can be located to **maximize grid value** rather than accommodate solar farm constraints:

| Factor | Standalone Advantage | Co-located Constraint |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **MLF** | Site in high-MLF regions (0.95-1.05) | Inherit solar farm's poor MLF (0.80-0.90) |
| **Congestion** | Capture localized price premiums | Compete with solar exports |
| **FCAS** | Position for ancillary services | Limited by solar site capabilities |
| **Transmission** | Avoid curtailment-prone areas | End-of-line locations typical |

<div class="callout callout-warning">
<div class="callout-title">
<span class="callout-icon">⚠️</span>
Location Lock-in
</div>
<p>Solar farms are typically located based on land availability and solar resource. These sites often have poor MLFs and face transmission constraints. Forcing a battery to share this location <strong>destroys arbitrage value</strong>.</p>
</div>

#### 2. Speed to Market

Standalone BESS projects can be deployed significantly faster:

| Project Type | Typical Timeline |
|--------------|------------------|
| **BESS only** | 12-18 months |
| **PV + BESS** | 24-36 months |
| **Modular augmentation** | 6-12 months |

For investors targeting near-term deployment to capture current market conditions, standalone provides critical time advantages.

#### 3. Asset Lifecycle Independence

Battery and solar have fundamentally different operational lives:

- **BESS**: 15-20 years before major augmentation/replacement needed
- **PV**: 30-35 years asset life
- **Mismatch risk**: Battery reaches end-of-life while PV continues operating

Standalone deployment avoids the complexity of shared infrastructure replacement decisions and misaligned ownership structures.

#### 4. Negative Pricing Revenue

<div class="key-finding key-finding--battery">
<div class="key-finding-stat">Double-dip</div>
<div class="key-finding-label">Revenue from negative pricing: get paid to charge, then paid to discharge</div>
<p class="key-finding-description">
When wholesale prices go negative (excess solar), standalone batteries get <strong>paid to charge</strong> and can discharge hours later at positive prices. This revenue stream is largely unavailable to co-located batteries.
</p>
</div>

Co-located batteries **can** charge during negative prices, but only by curtailing their own solar generation to create grid import capacity. This is rarely economically optimal.

### The "Pure Merchant" Misconception

<div class="callout callout-note">
<div class="callout-title">
<span class="callout-icon">ℹ️</span>
Standalone ≠ Merchant
</div>
<p>Standalone BESS are <strong>not</strong> synonymous with pure merchant/volatility exposure. Many operate under:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tolling agreements:</strong> Fixed capacity payments + merchant upside</li>
<li><strong>FCAS contracts:</strong> Firm grid services revenue</li>
<li><strong>CfD structures:</strong> Contracted arbitrage with price hedging</li>
<li><strong>CIS contracts:</strong> Government-backed revenue floor</li>
</ul>
<p>The key distinction is that standalone batteries choose location to <strong>maximize</strong> these revenue opportunities.</p>
</div>

## The Case for Co-located: Capital Efficiency & Product Definition

Despite standalone advantages, co-location can be the optimal choice under specific conditions. The decision depends on the investor's objectives and the specific solar asset situation.

### Co-location Configuration Models

</div>

### Configuration Comparison

| Configuration | Connection | DUIDs | Grid Charging | Capex Savings | Dispatch Flexibility |
|---------------|------------|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Non-hybrid** | Separate | Dual | Yes (battery) | None | Maximum |
| **AC-coupled** | Shared | Dual | Yes (battery) | $50-100/kW | High |
| **DC-coupled** | Shared | Single | Limited | $70-120/kW | Constrained |

### Strategic Advantages of Co-located BESS

#### 1. Capex Synergies

<div class="key-finding">
<div class="key-finding-stat">$50-100/kW</div>
<div class="key-finding-label">Typical infrastructure savings from co-location</div>
<p class="key-finding-description">
Shared grid connection, electrical infrastructure, land, and planning approvals. For 100+ MW battery with 200+ MW solar, savings can exceed <strong>$10-20M in total capex</strong>.
</p>
</div>

#### 2. Capital Deployment Scale

Infrastructure investors often **prefer** larger capital deployment per project:

- **Fee structures**: Investment management fees scale with AUM
- **Transaction costs**: Due diligence and legal costs are largely fixed
- **Portfolio management**: Prefer fewer, larger assets
- **Return on equity**: Larger projects = higher absolute return even at lower IRR

#### 3. The "Green Premium"

<h4 class="analysis-box-title">Guaranteed Renewable Source</h4>
<p class="analysis-box-subtitle">DC-coupled batteries can only charge from solar</p>

</div>
<div class="analysis-box-content">

- **Additionality proof**: Storage demonstrably shifts *new* renewable generation
- **Time-stamped GOs**: Renewable certificates matched to consumption hour
- **ESG credibility**: Corporate buyers value "pure green" electrons
- **Premium value**: Typically $5-15/MWh over brown power

</div>
</div>

#### 4. CIS Eligibility (Australia-Specific)

Australia's Capacity Investment Scheme provides government-backed contracts. Co-located solar+storage projects are **explicitly eligible**, providing:

- Long-term revenue floor
- Reduced financing cost (government credit support)
- Competitive advantage vs. standalone (which may not qualify)

#### 5. The Retrofit Logic

<div class="callout callout-important">
<div class="callout-title">
<span class="callout-icon">🚨</span>
Defensive Co-location
</div>
<p>For investors with <strong>existing PV portfolios</strong> approaching PPA expiry, co-location is often a defensive necessity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add BESS to create firmable capacity</li>
<li>Structure new PPA for shaped delivery</li>
<li>Accept <strong>lower BESS return</strong> to preserve overall project IRR</li>
</ul>
<p>The comparison isn't "co-located vs. standalone"—it's "co-located BESS vs. uncontracted merchant solar."</p>
</div>

## Revenue Structure: Where Batteries Make Money

Understanding **how** batteries generate revenue is critical to evaluating the co-location decision. Battery returns are highly concentrated in specific price events.

### Revenue Concentration by Price Bucket

</p>
<div class="chart-placeholder-insight">
<strong>Key Insight:</strong> Significant revenue from negative pricing (get paid to charge) and extreme high-price events (>$1000/MWh). Normal prices ($0-300/MWh) contribute minimal revenue.
</div>
</div>
<div class="chart-footer">
<span class="chart-source">Data: AEMO dispatch data via NEMOSIS (2025)</span>
<span class="chart-code-link">Script: scripts/section3/s3_battery_revenue_buckets.py</span>
</div>
</div>

**Critical observations:**

1. **Negative pricing revenue**: Standalone batteries earn revenue by charging during negative prices (getting **paid** to charge). This is unavailable to DC-coupled co-located batteries.

2. **High-price event concentration**: Extreme price events (>$1000/MWh) drive substantial revenue. These occur during tight supply-demand conditions.

3. **Base revenue is minimal**: "Normal" market conditions ($0-300/MWh) contribute relatively little. Battery economics depend on price volatility, not average prices.

### Implications for Co-location

| Configuration | Negative Pricing | High-Price Events | Overall Flexibility |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Standalone** | Full access | Optimized dispatch | Maximum |
| **AC-coupled** | Partial (curtail solar) | Good | High |
| **DC-coupled** | None | Constrained | Limited |

## Decision Framework Summary

### Configuration Choice Drivers

**Choose Non-hybrid when:**
- MLF differential is significant between sites
- Battery targets different revenue streams (FCAS, different price zone)
- Maximum dispatch flexibility required

**Choose AC-coupled when:**
- Capex savings are material
- Independent dispatch still valuable
- Common retrofit scenario

**Choose DC-coupled when:**
- Creating "guaranteed green" product (corporate PPA requirement)
- Grid charging explicitly unwanted
- Maximum capex savings prioritized

The configuration choice is **not** purely technical—it's driven by commercial objectives (PPA structure, green premium, financing requirements).
