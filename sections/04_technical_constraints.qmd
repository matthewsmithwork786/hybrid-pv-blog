# Technical Constraints & Location Value {#sec-technical-constraints}

## The Revenue Concentration Problem

Battery revenue in the NEM is not evenly distributed across time. A small fraction of hours drive the majority of returns, making location optimization critical for economic viability.

### Revenue Skew: The 80/20 Reality

The following analysis examines NSW batteries operational throughout 2025, plotting cumulative revenue against cumulative time (hours sorted by revenue descending):

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.append(str(Path.cwd() / "scripts" / "section4"))

from IPython.display import IFrame
chart_path = Path.cwd() / "data" / "outputs" / "section4" / "revenue_skew.html"
IFrame(str(chart_path), width=800, height=500)
```

**Critical implications:**

1. **Extreme concentration**: 50% of annual revenue is generated in just ~10% of operating hours
2. **Volatility dependence**: Battery economics depend on price extremes, not average prices
3. **Location sensitivity**: Missing key high-price events (due to curtailment, poor MLF, or grid constraints) materially impacts returns

**Why this matters for co-location:**

- **DC-coupled batteries** may miss high-price discharge events if solar is generating (constrained by inverter capacity)
- **Poor MLF locations** compound revenue loss during critical high-price periods
- **Transmission curtailment** disproportionately impacts returns by eliminating top revenue hours

The investment decision hinges on capturing these fat-tail events. Standalone batteries optimize for this by siting in high-MLF locations with minimal curtailment risk.

## Marginal Loss Factors: The Hidden Tax

### Understanding MLF Impact

Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs) represent the energy lost when electricity passes through the transmission network. Generators are paid (or pay) based on MLF-adjusted prices:

- **MLF > 1.0**: Generator receives premium (located near load centers, minimal losses)
- **MLF = 1.0**: Neutral (hub pricing reference)
- **MLF < 1.0**: Discount applied (end-of-line locations, high transmission losses)

**Example:** If wholesale price = $100/MWh and MLF = 0.90:
- Generator receives: $100 × 0.90 = $90/MWh
- 10% discount due to transmission losses

For batteries arbitraging price spreads, MLF affects both discharge revenue and charging cost:
- **Discharge**: Revenue discounted by MLF
- **Charge**: Cost discounted by MLF (pay less to charge)

Net impact depends on price spread and MLF differential between charge/discharge locations.

### MLF vs Revenue: The Correlation

The following scatter plot shows the relationship between MLF and annual revenue per MW for NSW batteries:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

from IPython.display import IFrame
chart_path = Path.cwd() / "data" / "outputs" / "section4" / "mlf_impact_revenue.html"
IFrame(str(chart_path), width=800, height=500)
```

**Key findings:**

1. **Strong positive correlation**: Higher MLF → Higher revenue/MW (as expected)
2. **Revenue spread**: Even at similar MLFs, revenue varies significantly due to:
   - Dispatch strategy (merchant vs contracted)
   - Battery duration (2hr vs 4hr systems)
   - Local market conditions (FCAS availability, congestion)
3. **Material impact**: Moving from MLF 0.85 to 0.95 can increase annual revenue by 15-25%

**Implications for co-location:**

- **Solar farm locations** typically have poor MLFs (0.80-0.90) due to end-of-line siting
- **Standalone batteries** can target high-MLF locations (0.95-1.05) near load centers
- **MLF penalty** on co-located batteries reduces arbitrage revenue during critical high-price events

**The revenue compounding effect:**

During a $2000/MWh price event:
- **Standalone battery (MLF 0.98)**: Earns $1960/MWh discharged
- **Co-located battery (MLF 0.88)**: Earns $1760/MWh discharged
- **Difference**: $200/MWh × 100MW × 2hr = $40,000 per event

For batteries dependent on extreme price events, MLF location is a make-or-break factor.

## The MLF Geography: Mapping Location Value

### Spatial Distribution of Loss Factors

MLF values vary dramatically across the NSW network, reflecting the distance from load centers and transmission network constraints:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

from IPython.display import IFrame
map_path = Path.cwd() / "data" / "outputs" / "section4" / "mlf_map_nsw.html"
IFrame(str(map_path), width=800, height=600)
```

**Geographic patterns:**

1. **High MLF zones (green, >0.95)**:
   - Near Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong (load centers)
   - Well-connected transmission corridors
   - Minimal line losses

2. **Medium MLF zones (yellow, 0.90-0.95)**:
   - Regional centers with adequate transmission
   - Some renewable development areas

3. **Low MLF zones (red, <0.90)**:
   - Western NSW and end-of-line locations
   - Areas with high solar/wind development (resource-rich, transmission-poor)
   - High congestion and curtailment risk

**The co-location dilemma:**

Solar farms require large land areas and high solar resource, which are typically found in regional areas with **poor MLFs**. Batteries co-located with solar inherit this penalty.

Standalone batteries can be sited near load centers with **excellent MLFs**, maximizing arbitrage revenue.

### Case Study: Solar vs Battery MLF Differential

**Typical solar farm location:** Western NSW
- Solar resource: Excellent
- MLF: 0.85-0.90
- Curtailment risk: High (transmission constraints)

**Typical standalone battery location:** Central Coast NSW
- Transmission: Excellent (near Sydney load center)
- MLF: 0.98-1.02
- Curtailment risk: Low
- FCAS opportunities: Abundant

**Revenue impact:**

A 100MW/200MWh battery earning $10M/year at MLF 0.88 would earn $11.5-12M/year at MLF 0.98 (15-20% uplift) — **without changing dispatch strategy or market conditions**.

This location-driven revenue differential is larger than the capex savings from co-location.

## Network Constraints and Curtailment Risk

### The Transmission Bottleneck

Even with favorable MLF, batteries face curtailment risk when transmission networks are constrained. This disproportionately impacts revenue by eliminating top-earning hours.

**Curtailment mechanisms:**

1. **System security constraints**: Generator output restricted to maintain frequency/stability
2. **Network limits**: Transmission lines at capacity, exports restricted
3. **Local network issues**: Voltage or thermal limits in distribution networks

**Impact on revenue concentration:**

Since 50% of revenue comes from ~10% of hours (typically high-price periods with tight system conditions), curtailment during these events has an outsized impact on annual returns.

**Co-location vulnerability:**

- **Solar-heavy regions** face more curtailment (midday surplus)
- **Co-located batteries** may be curtailed when solar is exporting (network constraint)
- **Behind-the-meter batteries** forced to charge/discharge to match solar, missing optimal arbitrage windows

**Standalone advantage:**

- **Independent dispatch** can respond to market signals without solar constraints
- **High-MLF locations** typically have better transmission access
- **FCAS services** provide alternative revenue during curtailment events

## The Location Optimization Framework

### Site Selection Hierarchy

For battery investors, location optimization follows a clear hierarchy:

1. **MLF maximization** (primary revenue driver)
2. **Curtailment risk minimization** (protect top-decile revenue hours)
3. **Price volatility exposure** (ensure sufficient price spread)
4. **FCAS market access** (ancillary services revenue)
5. **Transmission capacity** (ability to export full capacity)

**Co-location can make sense when:**

- **Grid upgrades planned**: Transmission improvements will improve MLF/reduce curtailment
- **Green premium sufficient**: ESG buyers pay enough to offset MLF penalty
- **Retrofit scenario**: Adding battery to existing solar (location constraint already exists)
- **CIS eligibility**: Government contracts compensate for location disadvantage

**Standalone preferred when:**

- **Greenfield development**: Free to choose optimal location
- **Merchant exposure**: Targeting pure arbitrage without PPA protection
- **High hurdle rates**: Need maximum revenue per MW
- **FCAS focus**: Ancillary services revenue is significant

## Beyond Revenue: Operational Considerations

### Battery Duration and MLF Sensitivity

Longer-duration batteries (4hr+) are **less sensitive to MLF** than 2hr systems because:

- **Fewer cycles**: Lower annual revenue per MW capacity, so MLF impact is diluted
- **Energy arbitrage focus**: Capturing day-night spread rather than intraday volatility
- **Capacity payments**: May be contracted for capacity rather than energy arbitrage

However, 2hr batteries (the current market standard) are **highly MLF-sensitive** because they rely on rapid cycling during price spikes — the exact events where MLF adjusts the absolute revenue.

### Degradation and Revenue Quality

High-MLF locations often correlate with:
- **More cycling**: Volatile prices = frequent charge/discharge = faster degradation
- **Higher temperatures**: Load centers = hotter climate = reduced battery life

Investors must balance:
- **Higher revenue** (good MLF)
- **Higher opex** (increased maintenance, shorter replacement cycle)

Standalone batteries in high-MLF locations may face 15-20% higher degradation rates than co-located batteries in milder climates — partially offsetting the revenue advantage.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Battery revenue is highly concentrated: 50% of revenue from ~10% of hours
- MLF materially impacts returns: 15-25% revenue difference between poor (0.85) and excellent (0.98) locations
- Solar farms typically have poor MLFs (0.80-0.90) due to end-of-line siting
- Standalone batteries can access high-MLF locations (0.95-1.05) near load centers
- Curtailment risk disproportionately impacts returns by eliminating top revenue hours
- Location-driven revenue differential often exceeds capex savings from co-location
- Duration matters: 2hr batteries more MLF-sensitive than 4hr+ systems
- Operational factors (degradation, temperature) partially offset high-MLF advantages
