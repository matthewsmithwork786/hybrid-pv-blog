## The Revenue Concentration Problem

Battery revenue in the NEM is not evenly distributed across time. A small fraction of hours drive the majority of returns, making location optimization critical for economic viability.

### Revenue Skew: The 80/20 Reality

The following analysis examines NSW batteries operational throughout 2025, plotting cumulative revenue against cumulative time (hours sorted by revenue descending):

<p class="key-finding-description">
Battery economics depend entirely on capturing extreme price events. Missing even a few of these critical hours—due to curtailment, poor MLF, or grid constraints—materially impacts annual returns.
</p>
</div>

**Critical implications:**

1. **Extreme concentration**: 50% of annual revenue is generated in just ~10% of operating hours
2. **Volatility dependence**: Battery economics depend on price extremes, not average prices
3. **Location sensitivity**: Missing key high-price events (due to curtailment, poor MLF, or grid constraints) materially impacts returns

Why This Matters for Co-location
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC-coupled batteries</strong> may miss high-price discharge events if solar is generating (constrained by inverter capacity)</li>
<li><strong>Poor MLF locations</strong> compound revenue loss during critical high-price periods</li>
<li><strong>Transmission curtailment</strong> disproportionately impacts returns by eliminating top revenue hours</li>
</ul>
</div>

The investment decision hinges on capturing these fat-tail events. Standalone batteries optimize for this by siting in high-MLF locations with minimal curtailment risk.

## Marginal Loss Factors: The Hidden Tax

### Understanding MLF Impact

Marginal Loss Factors (MLFs) represent the energy lost when electricity passes through the transmission network. Generators are paid (or pay) based on MLF-adjusted prices:

| MLF Value | Meaning | Typical Location |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **> 1.0** | Premium received | Near load centers (Sydney, Newcastle) |
| **= 1.0** | Neutral (hub reference) | Regional reference nodes |
| **< 1.0** | Discount applied | End-of-line, high transmission losses |

**Example calculation:** If wholesale price = $100/MWh and MLF = 0.90:

- Generator receives: $100 × 0.90 = **$90/MWh**
- 10% discount due to transmission losses

<div class="callout callout-note">
<div class="callout-title">
<span class="callout-icon">ℹ️</span>
MLF Impact on Battery Arbitrage
</div>
<p>For batteries arbitraging price spreads, MLF affects <strong>both</strong> discharge revenue and charging cost:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discharge:</strong> Revenue discounted by MLF</li>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> Cost discounted by MLF (pay less to charge)</li>
</ul>
<p>Net impact depends on price spread and MLF differential between charge/discharge locations.</p>
</div>

### MLF Geographic Distribution

The following interactive map shows MLF values for generators across NSW, revealing the critical location patterns that impact battery revenue:

*Use the layer controls to filter by technology type. Dark green = high MLF (>1.0), red = low MLF (<0.85).*

**Geographic patterns revealed:**

1. **High MLF zones (green, >0.95)**: Near Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong (load centers)
2. **Medium MLF zones (yellow, 0.90-0.95)**: Regional centers with adequate transmission
3. **Low MLF zones (red, <0.90)**: Western NSW and end-of-line locations (typical solar farm areas)

<div class="key-finding-label">Revenue differential between poor (0.85) and excellent (0.98) MLF locations</div>
<p class="key-finding-description">
Solar farms typically have poor MLFs (0.80-0.90) due to end-of-line siting. Standalone batteries can access high-MLF locations (0.95-1.05) near load centers, capturing significantly more revenue from the same dispatch strategy.

## The Revenue Compounding Effect

During high-price events, MLF differences compound dramatically:

<h4 class="analysis-box-title">MLF Impact During $2000/MWh Price Event</h4>
<p class="analysis-box-subtitle">100MW battery, 2-hour discharge</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="analysis-box-content">

| Location Type | MLF | Revenue per MWh | Event Revenue |
|--------------|-----|-----------------|---------------|
| **Standalone** (near Sydney) | 0.98 | $1,960 | **$392,000** |
| **Co-located** (Western NSW) | 0.88 | $1,760 | **$352,000** |
| **Difference** | — | $200/MWh | **$40,000 per event** |

Over a year with 50 such events, the MLF differential alone accounts for **$2M+ in lost revenue** for the co-located battery.

</div>
</div>

For batteries dependent on extreme price events, MLF location is a make-or-break factor.

## Network Constraints and Curtailment Risk

### The Transmission Bottleneck

Even with favorable MLF, batteries face curtailment risk when transmission networks are constrained. This disproportionately impacts revenue by eliminating top-earning hours.

**Curtailment mechanisms:**

1. **System security constraints**: Generator output restricted to maintain frequency/stability
2. **Network limits**: Transmission lines at capacity, exports restricted
3. **Local network issues**: Voltage or thermal limits in distribution networks

<div class="callout callout-important">
<div class="callout-title">
<span class="callout-icon">🚨</span>
Impact on Revenue Concentration
</div>
<p>Since <strong>50% of revenue comes from ~10% of hours</strong> (typically high-price periods with tight system conditions), curtailment during these events has an <strong>outsized impact</strong> on annual returns.</p>
</div>

**Co-location vulnerability:**

- **Solar-heavy regions** face more curtailment (midday surplus)
- **Co-located batteries** may be curtailed when solar is exporting (network constraint)
- **Behind-the-meter batteries** forced to charge/discharge to match solar, missing optimal arbitrage windows

**Standalone advantage:**

- **Independent dispatch** can respond to market signals without solar constraints
- **High-MLF locations** typically have better transmission access
- **FCAS services** provide alternative revenue during curtailment events

## The Location Optimization Framework

### Site Selection Hierarchy

For battery investors, location optimization follows a clear hierarchy:

1. **MLF maximization** (primary revenue driver)
2. **Curtailment risk minimization** (protect top-decile revenue hours)
3. **Price volatility exposure** (ensure sufficient price spread)
4. **FCAS market access** (ancillary services revenue)
5. **Transmission capacity** (ability to export full capacity)

### When Co-location Makes Sense

- **CIS eligibility**: Government contracts compensate for location disadvantage

</div>
</div>

## Beyond Revenue: Operational Considerations

### Battery Duration and MLF Sensitivity

Longer-duration batteries (4hr+) are **less sensitive to MLF** than 2hr systems because:

- **Fewer cycles**: Lower annual revenue per MW capacity, so MLF impact is diluted
- **Energy arbitrage focus**: Capturing day-night spread rather than intraday volatility
- **Capacity payments**: May be contracted for capacity rather than energy arbitrage

However, 2hr batteries (the current market standard) are **highly MLF-sensitive** because they rely on rapid cycling during price spikes — the exact events where MLF adjusts the absolute revenue.

### Degradation and Revenue Quality

High-MLF locations often correlate with:

- **More cycling**: Volatile prices = frequent charge/discharge = faster degradation
- **Higher temperatures**: Load centers = hotter climate = reduced battery life

Investors must balance:

- **Higher revenue** (good MLF) vs **Higher opex** (increased maintenance, shorter replacement cycle)

Standalone batteries in high-MLF locations may face 15-20% higher degradation rates than co-located batteries in milder climates — partially offsetting the revenue advantage.
