The problem is straightforward: when everyone generates at the same time, prices collapse.\n\n1.2.1 Solar Anti-Correlation\nThe wholesale electricity price during solar hours (10:00-16:00) in NSW tells the story clearly:\n\n\n\n☀️ Solar Price Collapse & Curtailment Growth\n\nIn Progress\n\n\n\n📊\n\n\nNSW Solar Hour Prices & Curtailment (2018-2025)\n\n\nDual-axis chart showing annual average wholesale prices during solar hours (10:00-16:00) in NSW and solar curtailment percentage.\n\n\nKey Trend: Prices declined from ~$85/MWh (2018) to &lt;$40/MWh (2025) while curtailment increased from &lt;1% to &gt;5%.\n\n\n\nData: AEMO via NEMOSIS (2018-2025) Script: scripts/section1/s1_solar_price_curtailment.py\n\n\n\n\n\n50%\n\n\nDecline in solar-hour wholesale prices (2018-2025)\n\n\nSolar hour wholesale prices in NSW have collapsed from approximately $80-90/MWh to less than $40/MWh, while curtailment has increased from less than 1% to over 5%.\n\n\n\nThe data reveals two devastating trends for solar investors:\n\nPrice Cannibalization: Solar hour wholesale prices have declined by over 50% from 2018 to 2025\nPhysical Curtailment: Solar generators are not just facing low prices—they’re being physically curtailed due to grid congestion during solar peaks. Curtailment has increased &gt;5x over the same period.\n\n\n1.2.2 The PPA Problem\nInfrastructure investors don’t just want high prices—they need contracted revenue. The challenge is that corporate offtakers increasingly refuse to sign long-term PPAs for plain solar at any price. Why would a commercial buyer lock in a fixed rate for power that’s only generated when grid prices are lowest?\n\n\n\n📉\n\n\n\nThe Broken Financing Waterfall\n\n\nHow uncontracted revenue blocks project finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStage\nProblem\nConsequence\n\n\n\n\nContracting\nCan’t secure long-term PPA\nRevenue uncertainty\n\n\nDebt sizing\nLenders won’t underwrite merchant risk\nLower leverage possible\n\n\nReturn hurdles\nReduced debt → lower equity returns\nCan’t hit target IRR\n\n\nCapital deployment\nProject doesn’t proceed\nCapital sits idle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 The Certificate Cliff\nThe revenue problem extends beyond wholesale electricity.

However, GOs include a time-stamp element—certificates are matched to the exact hour of consumption.\n\n\nJust as physical solar-hour power is oversupplied, solar-hour GOs will likely trade at a significant discount to off-peak certificates, further depressing returns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 The Curtailment Risk\nInvestors are not just facing revenue risk from low prices.

Battery storage has transitioned from niche to mainstream infrastructure.\n\n\n\nData: AEMO NEM Generation Information Script: scripts/section3/s3_bess_capacity_growth.py\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 The Standalone Model\nCurrent market reality: The majority of batteries in the NEM are deployed as standalone facilities. This is not by accident—it reflects deliberate optimization for multiple revenue streams.\n\n\n\n🗺️ Battery Co-location Patterns Across NEM\n\nIn Progress\n\n\n\n🗺️\n\n\nStandalone vs. Co-located Battery Map\n\n\nInteractive map showing standalone (purple) vs co-located (dark orange) batteries across the NEM. Co-located defined as within 1km of a solar PV facility.\n\n\nKey Insight: Most batteries operate standalone, positioned independently of solar generation for optimal grid value capture.\n\n\n\nData: OpenElectricity API + geospatial analysis Script: scripts/section3/s3_bess_map_colocation.py\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Strategic Advantages of Standalone BESS\n\n3.2.3.1 1. Siting Freedom\nStandalone batteries can be located to maximize grid value rather than accommodate solar farm constraints:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor\nStandalone Advantage\nCo-located Constraint\n\n\n\n\nMLF\nSite in high-MLF regions (0.95-1.05)\nInherit solar farm’s poor MLF (0.80-0.90)\n\n\nCongestion\nCapture localized price premiums\nCompete with solar exports\n\n\nFCAS\nPosition for ancillary services\nLimited by solar site capabilities\n\n\nTransmission\nAvoid curtailment-prone areas\nEnd-of-line locations typical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⚠️ Location Lock-in\n\n\nSolar farms are typically located based on land availability and solar resource. These sites often have poor MLFs and face transmission constraints. Forcing a battery to share this location destroys arbitrage value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3.2 2. Speed to Market\nStandalone BESS projects can be deployed significantly faster:\n\n\n\nProject Type\nTypical Timeline\n\n\n\n\nBESS only\n12-18 months\n\n\nPV + BESS\n24-36 months\n\n\nModular augmentation\n6-12 months\n\n\n\nFor investors targeting near-term deployment to capture current market conditions, standalone provides critical time advantages.\n\n\n3.2.3.3 3. Asset Lifecycle Independence\nBattery and solar have fundamentally different operational lives:\n\nBESS: 15-20 years before major augmentation/replacement needed\nPV: 30-35 years asset life\nMismatch risk: Battery reaches end-of-life while PV continues operating\n\nStandalone deployment avoids the complexity of shared infrastructure replacement decisions and misaligned ownership structures.\n\n\n3.2.3.4 4. Negative Pricing Revenue\n\n\nDouble-dip\n\n\nRevenue from negative pricing: get paid to charge, then paid to discharge\n\n\nWhen wholesale prices go negative (excess solar), standalone batteries get paid to charge and can discharge hours later at positive prices. This revenue stream is largely unavailable to co-located batteries.\n\n\nCo-located batteries can charge during negative prices, but only by curtailing their own solar generation to create grid import capacity. This is rarely economically optimal.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 The “Pure Merchant” Misconception\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nℹ️ Standalone ≠ Merchant\n\n\nStandalone BESS are not synonymous with pure merchant/volatility exposure. Many operate under:\n\n\n\nTolling agreements: Fixed capacity payments + merchant upside\n\n\nFCAS contracts: Firm grid services revenue\n\n\nCfD structures: Contracted arbitrage with price hedging\n\n\nCIS contracts: Government-backed revenue floor\n\n\n\nThe key distinction is that standalone batteries choose location to maximize these revenue opportunities.",
