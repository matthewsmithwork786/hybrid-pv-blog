## The Core Question

<div class="callout callout-tip">
<div class="callout-title">
<span class="callout-icon">💡</span>
Investment Decision
</div>
<p><strong>Does co-locating battery storage with solar PV create value, or does it destroy returns compared to standalone BESS deployment?</strong></p>
</div>

This report provides infrastructure investors with a comprehensive framework for evaluating battery energy storage system (BESS) investment decisions in Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM).

## Report Structure

### Part 1: The Investment Problem

Why the historical investment model for pure solar PV is broken, and why capital must pivot to storage-integrated solutions.

### Part 2: Trade-off Analysis

A direct comparison of standalone vs. co-located deployment models, including strategic advantages and revenue structure analysis.

### Part 3: Technical Constraints

The "hidden killers" of returns—revenue concentration, Marginal Loss Factors, and grid constraints that can make or break battery investments.

## Key Findings Preview

<div class="key-finding key-finding--battery">
<div class="key-finding-stat">50% in 10%</div>
<div class="key-finding-label">Revenue Concentration</div>
<p class="key-finding-description">
Battery returns are highly concentrated: <strong>50% of annual revenue is generated in just 10% of operating hours</strong>. This makes location optimization and dispatch flexibility critical.
</p>
</div>

<div class="key-finding key-finding--pv">
<div class="key-finding-stat">15-25%</div>
<div class="key-finding-label">MLF Revenue Impact</div>
<p class="key-finding-description">
Marginal Loss Factors have material impact on returns. High MLF locations (0.98+) can generate 15-25% more annual revenue than poor MLF locations (0.85) typical of solar farms.
</p>
</div>

### Co-location Trade-offs

<p class="analysis-box-subtitle">Key factors in the deployment decision</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="analysis-box-content">

| Factor | Standalone | Co-located |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Location** | Optimized for MLF/FCAS | Constrained by solar site |
| **Capex** | Full grid connection cost | Shared infrastructure ($50-100/kW saving) |
| **Grid charging** | Full flexibility | Limited (especially DC-coupled) |
| **Green premium** | None | Potential ESG/PPA premium |
| **CIS eligibility** | May not qualify | Explicitly eligible |

**Decision context matters:** Retrofit vs. greenfield, contracting options, return targets
