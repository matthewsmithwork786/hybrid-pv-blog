## About This Report

This report provides infrastructure investors with a comprehensive framework for evaluating battery energy storage system (BESS) investment decisions in Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM).

### The Core Question

> Does co-locating battery storage with solar PV create value, or does it destroy returns compared to standalone BESS deployment?

### Report Structure

1. **The Investment Problem** - Solar's economic challenges and the BESS opportunity
2. **Trade-off Analysis** - Standalone vs. co-located: A direct comparison  
3. **Technical Constraints** - MLF, revenue concentration, and location value

### Current Status

> **🚧 Work in Progress**
> 
> This report is under active development. Completed sections:
> - ✅ Section 1: Investment Problem
> - ✅ Section 3: Trade-off Analysis  
> - ✅ Section 4: Technical Constraints
> - 🚧 Additional sections: In development

### Key Findings (Preview)

#### Revenue Concentration
Battery returns are highly concentrated: **50% of annual revenue is generated in just 10% of operating hours**. This makes location optimization and dispatch flexibility critical.

#### Location Value Matters
Marginal Loss Factors (MLF) have material impact on returns:
- **High MLF (0.98+)**: $100k+/MW additional annual revenue
- **Low MLF (0.85)**: Significant revenue penalty
- **Solar farm locations**: Typically have poor MLFs (0.80-0.90)

#### Co-location Trade-offs
- **Pros**: Capex savings ($50-100/kW), green premiums, CIS eligibility
- **Cons**: Location constraints, reduced flexibility, MLF penalties
- **Decision context**: Retrofit vs. greenfield, contracting options, return targets
